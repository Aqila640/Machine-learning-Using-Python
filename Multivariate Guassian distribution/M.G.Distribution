Generate N = 500, 2-dimensional data points that are distributed according to the Gaussian
distributionN(m,S), with mean m = [0, 0]T and covariance matrix [s1,s2,s12]
cov=[[s1,s12],[s12,s2]]
Plot each data set and comment on the shape of the clusters formed by the data points.
#The Code 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

mean=[0,0]
cov=[[0.3,-0.5],[-0.5,2]]
N=500
x,y=np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,N).T
plt.plot(x,y,'x')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
